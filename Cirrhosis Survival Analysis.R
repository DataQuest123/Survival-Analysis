## About 75.6% of patients are expected to survive beyond day 1444.
## As time progresses, survival probability steadily declines, which is expected in clinical survival data.
## The survival curve is likely smooth and descending, with small drops at each death time.

## Female Patients (Sex = F)
## Initial n.risk: 242
## Survival probability decreases gradually, from 0.996 at day 41 to ~0.368 at day 3853.
## The standard error grows slowly (starting from 0.00412), indicating increasing uncertainty in the estimates as time progresses and fewer individuals remain.
## The survival curve is long and steady, with many small drops over time, suggesting more censored data and slower death accumulation.
## Key insight: Females show more gradual declines in survival with relatively better long-term survival.

## Male Patients (Sex = M)
## Initial n.risk: 34 (much fewer than females)
## Survival probability drops sharply, from 0.971 at day 140 to 0.163 at day 4191.
## The standard error is larger (starting at 0.0290), and the confidence intervals are wider, reflecting higher uncertainty due to the smaller sample size.
## Survival probability drops more rapidly than in females.
## Key insight: Male patients exhibit poorer survival outcomes, with faster and more pronounced drops in survival probability over time.

## Kaplan Meier Curves by Stage
## Convert Stage to factor 
data$Stage <- factor(data$Stage)

## KM fit by Stage
km_stage <- survfit(surv_obj ~ Stage, data = data)
summary(km_stage)

##Stage 1:
## Patients at Stage 1 had a relatively high survival probability. At the last recorded time (2386 days), survival was 87.5%, with a wide confidence interval due to small sample size (only 8 people at risk). Only 1 event (death) occurred, showing this group has the best prognosis.

## Stage 2:
## Patients show gradual declines in survival over time. Initially, survival is very high (98.3%), but it steadily drops as time progresses. By around 4079 days, survival drops to 39.7%, with increasing uncertainty (standard error and confidence intervals widen). This group starts well but worsens significantly in the long term.
                                                                                                  
## Stage 3:
## Survival in Stage 3 starts very high but declines more steeply than Stage 2. By about 4191 days, survival drops to 31.8%. This suggests worse outcomes than Stage 2, with a sharper decline and consistent loss of patients across time. The decreasing number at risk supports a pattern of ongoing events (deaths).
                                                                                                  
## Stage 4:
## This group shows the worst survival profile. Survival begins near 99% but declines rapidly. By just over 3760 days, survival drops to 14.8%. The drop is consistent and steep, and the confidence intervals tighten initially but widen significantly later, reflecting both high mortality and fewer people remaining.
                                                                                                  
## Overall Interpretation:
## Survival probability decreases with increasing stage of disease. Stage 1 has the best prognosis, followed by Stage 2, then Stage 3. Stage 4 shows the worst survival, with early and steady mortality. The consistent decline in higher stages highlights the clinical importance of early diagnosis and intervention.

summary(km_ascites)

## Patients Without Ascites (Ascites = N):
## These patients started with a large group (n = 257), and their survival probability declined slowly over time. At early time points, the probability remained above 95%, showing a favorable prognosis. The decline is gradual and consistent, and by the final observed time, survival probability is about 33.5%, with reasonable confidence intervals. The standard error remains low to moderate, indicating more reliable estimates due to the large sample size.
## This pattern indicates that patients without ascites live longer and experience fewer deaths over time compared to those with ascites.

## Patients With Ascites (Ascites = Y):
## This group had a smaller sample size (n = 19) and experienced a rapid decline in survival. By the time 400 days pass, survival drops to 31.6%, and it plummets to 0% by 3090 days. The confidence intervals widen quickly, and the standard error is high, indicating more variability and uncertainty in the estimatesâ€”partly due to the smaller number at risk.
## This suggests that ascites is strongly associated with a worse survival outcome, as patients with ascites died significantly earlier than those without.

## Overall Interpretation:
## The survival probability for patients without ascites is substantially higher and more stable over time than for those with ascites. Ascites is a poor prognostic factorâ€”patients with it show early and steep declines in survival, while those without it have a better and longer survival trajectory.

cox_surv_obj <- Surv(time = data$N_Days, event = data$death_event)

## Univariate Cox Model
cox_uni <- coxph(cox_surv_obj ~ Bilirubin, data = data)
summary(cox_uni)

## Coefficient (coef): 0.145 â€“ Positive value means higher bilirubin is associated with increased hazard.
## Hazard Ratio (exp(coef)): 1.156 â†’ For every 1 unit increase in Bilirubin, the hazard (risk of death) increases by ~15.6%.
## Confidence Interval (CI): [1.126, 1.188] â†’ Since the CI does not include 1, the effect is statistically significant.
## p-value < 2e-16: Highly significant â€” there's strong evidence that Bilirubin is a significant predictor of survival.

## Model Performance
## Concordance = 0.793 â†’ Indicates strong discriminative ability (i.e., the model can distinguish well between those who live longer vs shorter).
## Wald, Likelihood Ratio, and Score tests: All highly significant (p < 2e-16), reinforcing that Bilirubin is an important predictor.

## Clinical Interpretation
## Higher bilirubin levels are significantly associated with a greater risk of death among cirrhosis patients. This suggests Bilirubin could be an important marker for disease severity and prognosis.

## Multivariate Cox Model
cox_model <- coxph(cox_surv_obj ~ Age + Sex + Ascites + Drug + Albumin + 
                     Bilirubin + Prothrombin + Stage, data = data)
summary(cox_model)

## This Cox proportional hazards model shows how various clinical and demographic variables influence the risk of death (hazard) in a group of 276 patients, among whom 111 experienced the event of interest (death).
## Starting with age, its effect is minimal and not statistically significant at the 5% level, although the p-value (0.065) suggests a weak trend where older age might slightly increase the risk of death.
## Sex shows a significant effect. Being male increases the hazard of death by approximately 84% compared to being female, and this result is statistically significant with a p-value of 0.024. This means male patients are at higher risk of mortality.
## Ascites does not significantly affect survival in this model. Patients with ascites have a slightly higher hazard ratio (about 7% increase), but the p-value is very high (0.845), indicating no meaningful difference.
## The effect of drug assignment (placebo versus treatment) is also not significant. Patients on placebo have a slightly lower risk, but this finding is not statistically reliable (p = 0.586).
## Albumin is a strong and statistically significant predictor. Higher albumin levels substantially reduce the risk of death. In fact, each unit increase in albumin reduces the hazard by about 66%, with a p-value well below 0.001. This means albumin is highly protective.
## Bilirubin is another key predictor. Higher bilirubin levels are strongly associated with increased mortality risk. Each unit increase in bilirubin raises the hazard by around 13.5%, and this effect is highly significant (p < 0.001), suggesting bilirubin is a strong marker of disease severity.
## Prothrombin time also plays a significant role. An increase in prothrombin time raises the risk of death by about 27%, with a statistically significant p-value of 0.012. This indicates that impaired blood clotting is associated with poorer survival.
## Finally, disease stage is an important factor. With each increase in stage, the hazard increases by about 55%. This relationship is highly significant, showing that patients with more advanced disease have a higher risk of mortality.
## Overall, the model fits the data well, with a concordance of 0.83, indicating excellent predictive accuracy. All three global tests (likelihood ratio, Wald, and score tests) are significant, meaning the model as a whole is statistically robust.

# Check PH assumption
cox.zph(cox_model)
ggcoxzph(cox.zph(cox_model))

## This output is from the cox.zph() function, which tests the proportional hazards (PH) assumption for each covariate in your Cox model. If the PH assumption holds, the hazard ratio for a variable remains constant over time. Here's how to interpret the results:
## Age has a p-value of 0.084. This is not significant at the 0.05 level, but it's borderline, so the PH assumption may be slightly violated.
## Sex has a very high p-value of 0.972, indicating no violation of the PH assumption. Its hazard ratio can be considered stable over time.
## Ascites has a p-value of 0.062, also borderline. It suggests a possible, but not definitive, time-varying effect.
## Drug has a p-value of 0.463, showing no evidence of PH assumption violation.
## Albumin has a p-value of 0.360, also indicating that its effect on hazard is stable over time.
## Bilirubin has a significant p-value of 0.016. This means bilirubin violates the proportional hazards assumption, and its effect likely changes over time.
## Prothrombin has a p-value of 0.024, so it too violates the PH assumption, suggesting a time-varying hazard ratio.
## Stage has a borderline p-value of 0.059, implying a possible, weak violation.
## Finally, the GLOBAL test checks whether any covariate in the model violates the PH assumption. With a p-value of 0.021, this test is significant. That means at least one variable (likely bilirubin and prothrombin) does not satisfy the proportional hazards assumption, and adjustments (like time-varying covariates or stratification) may be needed.
